# Dependency injection
`Dependency injection` is a design pattern;
if a class uses an object of a certain type we are also making that class
responsible for creating that object;
because it shifts the creation responsibility to another class dependency injection
is an inversion of control technique;
code is much easier to test;
`Dependency inversion` is a principle of SOLID
aims to decouple concrete classes using abstractions
